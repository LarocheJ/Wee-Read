    <p class="center">You can implement this program in a few simple steps:</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-between align-middle steps">
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 1: Recruit and Onboard Volunteers</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Family volunteers</li>
                <li>Business partners</li>
                <li>Faith-based groups</li>
                <li>Service clubs (e.g., Rotary)</li>
                <li>Local bank branch</li>
                <li>Staff and personnel at centre/agency</li>
                <li>Post-Secondary students</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 2: Complete Paperwork</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>All volunteers are required to complete volunteer clearances as designated by your board, such as Police Information Checks with clearance to work with vulnerable populations. These must be processed and cleared prior to training.</li>
                <li>Once volunteers are cleared to work with children, they will need to complete their training module. Keep a copy of their Certificate of Completion on-site.</li>
                <li>Every child in the program will also need a signed permission form prior to participating.</li>
                <li>Make sure you give an orientation to all volunteers on centre, such as locations of learning spaces and washrooms, emergency procedures, parking instructions, and important contacts.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex justify-between align-middle steps">
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 3: Gather Supplies</h3>
            <p>For every program you run you will need to download and print:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Printed copies of the <em>pee wee read</em> module</li>
                <li><em>pee wee read</em> tracking sheets</li>
                <li>Printable Activities; The Name Game, Letter Hunt, Animal Sounds, Nursery Rhymes, and &ldquo;50 Books to Read Before You Are 5&rdquo; (master copies in the Resources Section)</li>
                <li>Scissors</li>
                <li>Name tags and permanent markers (optional)</li>
                <li>Books (see below)</li>
                <li>A large plastic bin to hold the books</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 4: Create your Book Bin</h3>
            <p>It&#39;s best to take the guess work out of book selection so that you ensure volunteers are choosing books that are fun and appropriate for very young children. For this reason, we encourage you to pre-select the books and place them in a large plastic tub. Each week, before the volunteers go to the classroom to get the children they will read with, they will select three to four books from the tub. You should have 30 to 40 books available in your tub. Here are some guidelines for the types of books to choose for the 3-5 Bin:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Include high quality fiction and non-fiction picture books</li>
                <li>Include new and familiar stories and classroom favourites</li>
                <li>Ensure books are age-appropriate for children ages 3-5</li>
                <li>Ensure books can be read from beginning-to-end in 15 minutes or less</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Important: If your volunteers read for more than eight weeks you will need to rotate the books from time to time to make sure that there is enough selection. We suggest you replenish the Book Bin every month.</p>

            <h3>Step 5: Select Students</h3>
            <p>Work with staff to develop a list of children who would benefit from the <em>pee wee read</em> program.  The number of children you select will depend on the number of volunteers you have and the number of sessions they are able to provide each week. For example, if you have 10 volunteers who are willing to come to the school for an hour each week, they will be able to complete two sessions in that time. Based on two children per volunteer per session, this means that you can select 40 children. (Ideally, you should have two children per volunteer.)</p>
            <p>Here are some criteria that you might like to consider when selecting participants:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>A child who is not already receiving additional supports for exceptional needs</strong></li>
                <li>A child who would enjoy special time with a caring volunteer and needs encouragement to interact with books and peers</li>
                <li>A child who would benefit from opportunities to think and talk about stories, and make connections with home and community experiences</li>
                <li>A child who needs encouragement to express ideas, thoughts, and feelings to others</li>
                <li>A child who needs support with emergent literacy skills, such as awareness of print and letter-sound correspondence and listening skills</li>
                <li>A child who would benefit from an opportunity to acquire information about word meanings and needs growth in vocabulary and understanding content</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can use the Volunteer/Child Assignments form (in Resources) to record which volunteer will be working with which children. These can then be given to the volunteers during the orientation session.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 6: Develop a Schedule</h3>
            <p>Work with your volunteers to select a weekly day and time for the session. Make sure you let the Classroom and Office Administration know the dates for the program.</p>
            <p>Remember all Police Checks that are required by most school jurisdictions must be approved and <em>pee wee read</em> training completed before the volunteers start reading with children.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Volunteer Training</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Volunteers will complete online training at their own pace and will provide a Certificate of Completion when finished. Please feel free to invite new volunteers to complete the training.</li>
                    <li>You will want to give a tour to new volunteers; orient them to the office, introduce them to all staff, show them where the  reading spaces and washrooms are, and review emergency procedures and centre procedures (such as parking, etc).</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="d-flex justify-between align-middle steps">
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 7: Run it!</h3>
            <p>This is the easy part. All you need to do is welcome and encourage your volunteers, be available for their questions, and check in with them to make sure everything is running smoothly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 8: Evaluate it!</h3>
            <p>In order to track progress and ensure the program is as effective as possible, please remind volunteers of the online survey link. We would also love to hear your feedback and any suggestions you might have for how to improve the program.</p>

        <div class="w-100">
            <h3>Step 9: Do it again!</h3>
            <p>Once you see how much children benefit from this program – and how enjoyable it is for volunteers – you will want to start planning your next eight-week session.</p>
            <p>You have completed the <em>pee wee read</em> administrator training. Please use what you have learned to guide your school in the powerful pee wee read process. Thank you for committing to help children to become confident and joyful readers!</p>

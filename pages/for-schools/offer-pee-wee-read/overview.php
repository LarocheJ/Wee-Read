            <p><em>pee wee read</em> is an eight-week program that matches adult volunteers with preschool-age children to share books and conversation. The program is designed to early literacy and pre-reading skills and help children develop their listening, oral language skills, and a love of books.  Volunteers are matched with two children. For about 20 to 30 minutes each week, the volunteers read a story to their children, talk about the book, and play games that support literacy skills. Because they meet with the same children each week, the volunteer gets to know the children and develop a bond. This makes the time together enjoyable and special. Children develop positive attitudes about reading, and volunteers gain the satisfaction of knowing they have made a huge contribution to their reading friendâ€™s success, both now and into the future.</p>

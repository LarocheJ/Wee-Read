&ldquo;Extensive pleasant experiences with read-alouds enables children to see themselves as readers and to become readers more quickly and easily than any other single experience we can provide.&rdquo;

<blockquote>
&ldquo;Reading aloud reveals the rewards of reading and develops the listeners interest in books and desire to be a reader.&rdquo;

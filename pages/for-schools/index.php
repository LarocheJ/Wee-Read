        <p>Become a <em>wee read</em> school or a <em>pee wee read</em> early childhood centre!</p>
        <p>An administrator from your organization will need to create a log-in and complete the Administrator Training in order to have your location listed. You will also need to ensure that your organization has the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volunteer Screening and Orientation processes in place</li>
            <li>Liaison on staff who will support Volunteers in their work</li>
            <li>Printer for Additional Resources </li>
            <li>A variety of engaging picture books, from multiple genres, stored conveniently for the Volunteers to access</li>
            <li>Quiet, high-visibility place where children and volunteers can read together</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Once you have completed the administratorâ€™s module you will be able to start interviewing volunteers to read with children at your organization.</p>
        <p>It is up to the discretion of your organization to accept Volunteers. Listing your organization as a <em><strong>wee read</strong></em> or <em><strong>pee wee read</strong></em> location means that you are ready to accept volunteers, however, it is your decision which volunteers will be the right fit for your program.</p>

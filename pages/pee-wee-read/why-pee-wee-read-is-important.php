    <p>Do you remember learning to read? Most grown-ups can’t, and that’s okay! What probably happened is that an important adult in your life shared books and stories with you, and this sparked a fire that made you want to learn more!</p>
    <p>Every child deserves to feel that spark, so here are a few things to remember:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Be Playful!</strong> The more fun you have, the more fun the children will have.</li>
        <li><strong>Show the Love!</strong> Communicate your excitement and joy for reading. It’s contagious, and we want to catch it.</li>
        <li><strong>Don’t force it!</strong> Children need to develop a positive relationship with books and reading, so we don’t want feel forced to read.</li>
    </ul>

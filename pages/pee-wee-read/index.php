    <p>You won’t be teaching a child <strong><em>HOW</em></strong> to read. Your job is to help us <strong><em>love books</em></strong> and make us <strong><em>want</em></strong> to learn to read, so that when we do get to school, we are ready! Before we learn how to read, we fall in love with the idea of reading; with books, stories, and most importantly, the people who share them with us!</p>
    <p>So that’s what you’re going to learn how to do. There are some simple things you can do with children EVERY DAY to help us <strong>fall in love with reading!</strong></p>

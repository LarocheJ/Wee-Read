            <p>Babies aren’t all born the same, thank goodness – the world needs everyone and all the things that make us unique! Some children are born visually impaired, non-hearing, and/or non-verbal, and there are ways that books and reading might be different for them, but still very important. </p>
            <p>Some of the tips and strategies you’ll be learning may work for most children. For other children, you may need to choose what works best. If you need extra information about supporting children with exceptional needs, please connect with health and education professionals in your area.</p>

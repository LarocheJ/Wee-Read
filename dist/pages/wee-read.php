        <p>Do you remember learning to read? Most of us cannot really recall this process. Reading a complex activity. Perhaps, without you even knowing, two of the most important things that helped you to become a reader were: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>having joyful experiences with books, and,</li>
            <li>building your confidence in your identity as a reader</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We want all children to be able to read with confidence and joy and you are helping to make that happen! You will help them to build their self-confidence, understand how magical and enjoyable books can be, and learn more about why it is fun and important to read.</p>

        <p>Remember, during these read aloud times, you are not teaching the child how to read. You are showing the child what there is to love about reading.</p>
